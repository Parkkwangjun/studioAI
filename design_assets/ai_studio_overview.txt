AI STUDIO APP – OVERVIEW & GLOSSARY
===================================

Product Vision
--------------
AI Studio is a dark-themed web application that automates content creation.

From one high-level idea, the user can:
- generate a full SCRIPT,
- turn each scene into TTS AUDIO,
- generate IMAGES per scene,
- turn images into short VIDEO clips.

Everything is scene-based: a scene is a single “one-breath” sentence or short paragraph.
The app is optimized for YouTube shorts, long-form videos, TikTok, Reels, etc.

Core Entities
-------------
- Project: one complete piece of content (e.g. 10‑min video, 1‑min short).
- Scene: smallest text unit within a project, ordered.
- Script: ordered list of scenes in a project.
- AudioClip: TTS audio file linked to a scene.
- ImageAsset: generated image linked to a scene or project.
- VideoClip: generated video linked to a project (and optionally scenes/images).
- Library: right-side panel that lists previously generated Scripts / Audio / Images / Videos.

Main Sections (Left Navigation)
-------------------------------
1) 스크립트 (Script)
2) 오디오 (Audio)
3) 이미지 (Image)
4) 비디오 (Video)
5) 설정 (Settings)

High-Level Workflow
-------------------
1. User goes to Script tab, enters options + prompt, and generates a script.
   → System splits result into scenes and creates a Project.

2. User goes to Audio tab, selects the script, and generates TTS per scene
   (individually or in batch).

3. User goes to Image tab, sees all scenes and generates images per scene.

4. User goes to Video tab, selects images and options, then generates a video clip.

5. Settings tab configures defaults (models, voices, styles, etc.).

This file should be read first to understand the intent of AI Studio before implementing any code.
